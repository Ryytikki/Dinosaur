#   dino_game.py - A sidescrolling puzzle game built from scratch in python 2.7.3 using a 	 #
# 	combination of the pygame and vlc libraries, built for Morgan Farrar's final year		 #
# 	project and as an experiment in using python for game development for myself. 			 #
#																							 #
#	Overall size comes to 12 files with around 1800 - 2000 lines (1885 at my last count), 	 #
#	not including the downloaded vlc library as that one kinda wasnt programmed by me.		 #
#	Total project time was around 12 months, including 2 total rebuilds, a rework of the     #
#	entire map script and recoding several objects from scratch								 #
#																							 #
#	I'd like to remind you all that this is a small scale project built by one programmer    #
#	and one artist. Now compare that to the AAA games which have thousands of employees over #
#	a huge number of departments. Starting to understand why game development is so costly?  #
